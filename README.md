## Reflection Questions

### Challenges faced during the project.
Challenges I faced while completing this is making sure all of my different conditions were accounted for, making sure  I met most if not all my MVP goals and making sure my code was simple as could be. 

### How you approached solving those challenges.
I tried refactoring where I could. I also tried getting down my basic functionality before I tried for the more complicated deliverables 

### What you would improve if given more time.
I would Improve the UI/UX and the functionality. I Would also improve the local storage functionality. It wonâ€™t randomly refresh which is good.
